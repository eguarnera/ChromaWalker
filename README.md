# Project Title

A Python package for exploring chromatin architecture through a random walk (Markov State Model) analysis of Hi-C data.

** NOTE: This readme is under construction. **

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Deployment on a server should require just the same steps.

### Prerequisites

This library is built for Python 2.7.

List of required Python libraries (versions):
* Numpy (1.14)
* Scipy (1.0)
* Pandas (0.22)
* Matplotlib (2.0)

### Installing

1. Install the SciPy stack

The most convenient way is to use pip:

```
python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib pandas
```

2. Copy package source to Python path
3. Basic usage of the package can be inferred by looking at the code that's run when you execute ChromaWalker.py as a main program. In other words, look at how the program is run in ChromaWalker.py, under the conditional statement:

```
if __name__ == “__main__”:
```
